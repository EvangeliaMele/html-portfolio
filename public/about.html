<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a student I am in a continuous search to solidify and excel my programming skills. 
I am keen on learning new tools and methodologies to expand my knowledge and experience 
in the field of computer science. 
My main goal is to stay aligned with the latest advancements of my field 
while still an undergraduate student and to apply them in the near future to achieve corporate targets 
and put my knowledge in good use.</p>
